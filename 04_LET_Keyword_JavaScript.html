    1. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
    2. Variables can be declared using the keywords: var, let, or const.
       The choice of keyword depends on the variableâ€™s scope and whether it needs to be reassigned.

    <script>
        // Declaring a variable using 'let'
        let a = 10;
        console.log("Value of a before reassignment: " + a); // Output: 10

        // Reassigning the variable
        a = 200;
        console.log("Value of a after reassignment: " + a); // Output: 200

        // Redeclaring a variable with 'let' in the same scope is not allowed
        // Uncommenting the line below will throw an error
        // let a = 300;

        // 'let' is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block where it is declared
        {
            let b = 500;
            console.log("Accessing b inside block: Allowed, value = " + b); // Output: 500
        }

        // Accessing 'b' outside its block will cause an error
        // Uncommenting the line below will throw an error
        // console.log("Accessing b outside block: Not allowed, causes error");

        // Reassigning or reusing 'b' outside its original block will also cause an error
        // Uncommenting the lines below will throw an error
        // b = 600;
        // console.log("Reassigning b outside block: Not allowed, causes error");

<!-- 
1. Variables declared using 'let' are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible 
   only within the block where they are declared.
2. Variables declared with 'let' can be reassigned to a new value within their scope.
3. Redeclaring variables with 'let' in the same scope is not allowed.
