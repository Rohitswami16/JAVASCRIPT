    Explanation:
    This script demonstrates the behavior of the `const` keyword in JavaScript:
    1. `const` is used to declare variables whose values cannot be reassigned.
    2. Variables declared with `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only 
       within the block where they are defined.
    -->

    <script>
        // Declaring a constant variable using 'const'
        const a = 10;
        console.log("Value of a before reassignment: " + a); // Output: 10

        // Reassignment is NOT allowed for variables declared with 'const'
        // Uncommenting the line below will throw a TypeError
        // a = 200;  
        // console.log("Value of a after reassignment: " + a);

        {
            // Declaring another constant variable within a block
            const b = 500;
            console.log("Accessing b inside block: Allowed, value = " + b); // Output: 500
        }

        // Accessing 'b' outside its block will cause an error
        // Uncommenting the line below will throw a ReferenceError
        // console.log("Accessing b outside block: Not allowed, causes error");
    </script>

<!-- 
Summary:
1. Variables declared with `const` are block-scoped, so they are accessible only within the block 
   where they are declared.
2. `const` variables cannot be reassigned after their initial declaration.
3. Attempting to access a `const` variable outside its block will result in a ReferenceError.

<!-- Excepted Output 
Value of a before reassignment: 10
Accessing b inside block: Allowed, value = 500
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
ReferenceError: b is not defined
