    What the Code Does:
    This script demonstrates the behavior of the `var` keyword in JavaScript. 
    It shows:
    1. How variables can be declared and reassigned.
    2. The scope of variables declared with `var` (function/global scope).
    3. Why using `var` for redeclaration is not recommended.
    -->

    <script>
        // Declaring a variable using 'var'
        var a = 10;
        console.log("Value of a before reassignment: " + a); // Output: 10

        // Reassigning the variable
        a = 200;
        console.log("Value of a after reassignment: " + a); // Output: 200

        // Variable declared with 'var' is function-scoped or global-scoped
        {
            // Declaring another variable using 'var' inside a block
            var b = 500;
            console.log("Accessing b inside block: Allowed, value = " + b); // Output: 500
        }

        // Variable 'b' declared inside the block is still accessible outside
        console.log("Accessing b outside block: Allowed, value = " + b); // Output: 500

        {
            // 'b' can still be accessed in a different block
            console.log("Accessing b inside another block: Allowed, value = " + b); // Output: 500
        }

        // Note: Redeclaring a variable with 'var' is technically allowed but not a good practice
        // Example:
        // var a = 300; // Uncommenting this would work, but avoid redeclaring variables unnecessarily.
    </script>

<!-- 
Summary of Key Concepts:
1. `var` is function-scoped or globally scoped (not block-scoped).
2. Variables declared with `var` can be reassigned and accessed outside their block.
3. Redeclaring variables with `var` is permitted but not recommended due to potential bugs.

<!-- Excepted Output -->
<!-- Value of a before reassignment: 10
Value of a after reassignment: 200
Accessing b inside block: Allowed, value = 500
Accessing b outside block: Allowed, value = 500
Accessing b inside another block: Allowed, value = 500 -->
